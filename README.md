# Characters-Calculator

Please check my new mini project with Javascript.

You can write one or more word, one or more sentences or numbers and the program will calculate the characters, the unique characters and 
it will print all the characters you wrote and the unique characters of your sentence.

The project uses HTML 5 and Javascript. Also, I developed it with Bootstrap library.


                                                    ######### STEPS #########

1. The user write the word(s), sentence(s) or number(s).
2. With Javascript the value is stored to a string
3. With split() and join(), I remove the spaces between words and I store the new value to a string.
4. With spread syntax i expand the letters to a new array
5. counterResult: print the length of the new array which is the characters number that the user typed.
6. With new Set() I removed the duplicate characters and store the unique only
7. Print the size of the unique only characters
8. Print the characters that the user wrote
9. Print the unique characters that the user wrote
